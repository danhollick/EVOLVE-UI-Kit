# EVOLVE-UI-Kit
UI Kit made with Fuse

## Running test server

The test server which provides basic JSON data is in the `TestServer` directory. It's built with node, so `npm install` is required to set things up.

Afterwards, simply running `node app` will start the server listening on port 6502. This can be overridden using an env var, like so: `httpPort=[port] node app`.

## Running project

As usual, `fuse preview`/`fuse build` is all you need. :)
